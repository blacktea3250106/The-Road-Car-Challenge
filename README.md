## Introduction

"The Road Car Challenge" is an exciting Java-based racing game that I developed during my freshman year to learn the Java programming language using Eclipse. Inspired by the classic arcade racing games, I set out to recreate the fun and thrill of those nostalgic experiences.

### Gameplay

In "The Road Car Challenge," players take control of a car and embark on an adrenaline-pumping journey. Here are some key features of the game:

- **Three Lives:** You start with three lives, and the game ends when you run out of them.
- **Game Objects:**
  - **Heart:** Collecting a heart replenishes one life, but it won't exceed your maximum life count.
  - **Rock:** Colliding with a rock deducts one life.
  - **Bomb:** Hitting a bomb ends the game instantly.
  - **Coin:** Gather coins to earn 100 currency points.
  - **Banana:** Colliding with a banana temporarily disrupts your steering for one second.
  - **Shield:** A shield can withstand one rock or bomb collision before disappearing.
  - **Invincibility Star:** Grabbing the star grants you invincibility for 5 seconds, allowing you to pass through obstacles unharmed.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the car's movement.
- Dodge rocks, bombs, and bananas while collecting hearts and coins to survive and score points.
- Use shields and invincibility stars strategically to stay in the game.
